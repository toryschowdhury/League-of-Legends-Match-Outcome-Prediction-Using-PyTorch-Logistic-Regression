# League-of-Legends-Match-Outcome-Prediction-Using-PyTorch-Logistic-Regression
In this project, we built a logistic regression model using PyTorch to predict League of Legends match outcomes based on various in-game statistics. Steps included data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training, optimization, evaluation, visualization, model saving/loading, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis.
